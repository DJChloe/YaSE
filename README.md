ZX Spectrum Emulator for Delphi Firemonkey

The emulator supports the ZX Spectrum 48k, 128k, 2A/3A, Pentagon and Scorpion models. It has been successfully tested 
under Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android. 
It is far away from being complete, but the initial development started in 1997 and stopped in 2000. I simply dont find time
to finish it, so any help will be welcome.

The license is LGPL.
